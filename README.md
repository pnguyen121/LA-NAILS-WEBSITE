L.A Nails Website

Created a full website for a local nail salon in Lawrenceburg Indiana, they previously had no website and in today's society it is very important!
Project Link -------> https://monumental-semolina-ca5f46.netlify.app/ <-----

Tech used:
This project was one of my first ones and was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I hosted it using netlify to be live on the internet. Full mobile styling and CSS was all done from scratch. No stylers used like bootstrap or materialize.

Future improvements: 
1. Buying a domain and using it.
2. Using googles API to showcase real time reviews
3. Allow some sort of request form for large parties.
